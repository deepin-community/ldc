Comment:
 LDC is released under the "three-clause BSD" LDC license reproduced below, with
 the following exceptions:
 .
 Compiler (bin/ in binary packages):
  - LDC uses the DMD frontend (dmd/* and dmd2/* in source code distributions),
    which was originally written by Walter Bright and is released under the
    Artistic license or the GPL version 1. LDMD (driver/ldmd.cpp) and the RTTI
    handling code (gen/typinf.cpp) are also partly derived from DMD.
 .
  - LDC incorporates code (gen/asmstmt.cpp and gen/asm-*.h) originally written
    by David Friedman for GDC and released under the Artistic license or the
    GPL version 2 or later.
 .
  - LDC uses the libconfig++ library under the terms of the GNU LGPL 2.1.
 .
  - The LDC project makes use of the LLVM framework, which is govenered by the
    University of Illinois Open Source License. A few LDC source files directly
    incorporate code derived from LLVM, see the file headers for details.
 .
 Libraries (lib/ and import/ in binary packages):
  - The D standard library, comprised of druntime (runtime/druntime) and
    Phobos (runtime/phobos), is distributed under the terms of the Boost
    Software License. See the individual source files for author information.

 ***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
 Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
 They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
 your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
 someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
 fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
 disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
 you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.
 .
 *BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
 By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
 etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
 this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
 a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
 sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
 you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
 medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.
 .
 ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
 This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
 tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
 Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
 Illinois Benedictine College (the "Project").  Among other
 things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
 on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
 distribute it in the United States without permission and
 without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
 below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
 under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.
 .
 To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
 efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
 works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
 medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
 things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
 intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
 disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
 codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
 .
 LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
 But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
 [1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
 etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
 legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
 UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
 INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
 OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
 receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
 you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
 time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
 on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
 such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
 copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
 choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
 receive it electronically.
 .
 THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
 TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
 LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
 .
 Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
 the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
 above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
 may have other legal rights.
 .
 INDEMNITY
 You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
 officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
 and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
 indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
 [1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
 or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.
 .
 DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
 You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
 disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
 "Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
 or:
 .
 [1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
      requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
      etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
      if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
      binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
      including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
      cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
      *EITHER*:
 .
      [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
           does *not* contain characters other than those
           intended by the author of the work, although tilde
           (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
           be used to convey punctuation intended by the
           author, and additional characters may be used to
           indicate hypertext links; OR
 .
      [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
           no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
           form by the program that displays the etext (as is
           the case, for instance, with most word processors);
           OR
 .
      [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
           no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
           etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
           or other equivalent proprietary form).
 .
 [2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
      "Small Print!" statement.
 .
 [3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Project of 20% of the
      net profits you derive calculated using the method you
      already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
      don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
      payable to "Project Gutenberg Association / Illinois
      Benedictine College" within the 60 days following each
      date you prepare (or were legally required to prepare)
      your annual (or equivalent periodic) tax return.
 .
 WHAT IF YOU *WANT* TO SEND MONEY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?
 The Project gratefully accepts contributions in money, time,
 scanning machines, OCR software, public domain etexts, royalty
 free copyright licenses, and every other sort of contribution
 you can think of.  Money should be paid to "Project Gutenberg
 Association / Illinois Benedictine College".
